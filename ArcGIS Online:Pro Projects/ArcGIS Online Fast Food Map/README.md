# ArcGIS Online: Fast Food Map
This is a group project involving a mobile survey conducted using Fulcrum and ArcGIS Online. We utilized Fulcrum to gather data on fast food restaurants in Northern Seattle by physically visiting each location and inputting GPS coordinates manually. Subsequently, we transferred the Fulcrum data to ArcGIS Online to create an interactive map. Upon selecting a restaurant, a pop-up menu displays the restaurant's statistics.
