# Overview of COVID-19 cases and rates

This assignment shows maps that are created from the data sources of COVID-19 regarding the cases and rates. The data is then made into an interactive map to engage the viewer with what is being presented to them.

**Primary Functions:** The functions that are used are interactive elements to  make the map more engaging, converting a shapefile into geojson, map on functions to construct the map, and async function.

**Libraries used:** Javascript, CSS, HTML, markdown, geojson, and shapefile.

**Credit and acknowledgement:** The walkthrough of this lab is from GEOG 458 course taught by Bo Zhao in the University of Washington.
