# Crime Database Mapping
This project aimed to use a PostgreSQL geodatabase in Jupyter Notebook for geoprocessing crime incidents data in Albuquerque, creating an interactive crime map with Python scripting. This optimized GIS processes, resulting in significant enhancements in operational efficiency and data accuracy.

Despite all the steps being followed correctly, not all the maps were showing on the html file. A bug, possibly within Jupyter Notebook, is causing some of the visualizations to not show properly. There are some photos to show how it looked.
