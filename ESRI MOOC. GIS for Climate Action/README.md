# ESRI MOOC: GIS for Climate Action
I enrolled in a GIS class that squarely tackled the urgent issue of climate change. Designed to equip participants with the tools to confront and illuminate climate-related challenges, the course delved into leveraging the latest ArcGIS capabilities for sustainable solutions. With a focus on driving positive action, we explored how GIS can elucidate risks and opportunities while fostering resilience in communities, systems, and infrastructure. Through this immersive experience, I honed advanced skills across a spectrum of ArcGIS tools, including ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Network Analyst, ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World, ArcGIS Instant Apps, ArcGIS Survey 123, ArcGIS Dashboards, and ArcGIS StoryMaps. These newfound capabilities empower me to craft visually captivating maps that effectively communicate intricate spatial data, fostering a deeper understanding of complex issues surrounding climate change.
